Adding to this list are all sorts of subtle gramatical shifts,
i.e. "Well, that fell into the category of things which could
have been put better, but I let him carry on."   Which to an
American sounds VERY British, even though an American COULD
possibly say it that way.  An American would more likely phrase
it, "Well, I though he could have said it better, but I let him 
go on." There are conventions of language and phrasing that are
difficult to pick out, as well as subtle differences in logic.
Most Americans think that the British habit of installing light
switches so they light turns on when the toggle is pulled DOWN is
very illogical.  In speaking you can say turn up the light to
replace turn on the light and carry the same meaning. Likewise
turn down the light sounds like approaching off.  But British
logic doesn't follow the same conventions.
